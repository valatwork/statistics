## Sample and Population

A **population** is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. It can mean a group containing elements of anything you want to study, such as objects, events, organizations, countries, species, organisms, etc.

A **sample** is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population.

### Collecting data from a population

Populations are used when your research question requires, or when you have access to, data from every member of the population.

Usually, it is only straightforward to collect data from a whole population when it is small, accessible and cooperative.

#### Population parameters

- $\mu$ (mu): the population mean
- $N$: the population size
- $\sigma$: the population standard deviation

### Using data from a population is preferable when:

1. Accuracy is crucial: If you want to conclude the entire population with as much accuracy as possible, it's best to collect data from the entire population rather than just a sample. This is particularly important when the population is relatively small or when the characteristics of interest within the population are highly variable.
2. Representativeness matters: When you need the sample to represent the entire population accurately, especially if there are subgroups within the population that you want to ensure are adequately represented.
Resources allow: If resources such as time, money, and personnel permit, collecting data from the entire population can provide the most comprehensive insights.
3. Unbiased analysis: Sometimes, researchers may want to avoid potential biases introduced by sampling methods. By collecting data from the entire population, they can eliminate sampling bias.

### Collecting data from a sample

A sample is a subset of individuals, items, or observations selected from a larger group or population to represent the characteristics of that larger group. In other words, it's a smaller, manageable portion of a population studied to make inferences about the whole population.

### Using data from a sample is preferable when:

- Studying a large population where it is impractical or impossible to collect data from every individual.
- Resources such as time, cost, and manpower are limited, making it more feasible to collect data from a subset of the population.
- Conducting research or experiments where it is important to minimize potential biases in data collection.

#### Sample parameters

- $\bar{x}$ (x-bar): the sample mean
- $n$: the sample size
- $s$: the sample standard deviation
