# Descriptive Statistics: Measures of Dispersion

*Dispersion* refers to measures of how spread out our data is. Typically, they’re statistics for which values near zero signify not spread out at all and for which large values (whatever that means) signify very spread out.

While measures of central tendency like mean, median, and mode give us an idea of the “typical” or “central” value in a dataset, measures of dispersion tell us how spread out the values are around that central point.



## Measures of dispersion: Absolute vs Relative

An **absolute measure of dispersion** shows the extent of variability in a dataset in the same units as the original data (i.e., currency, weight, volume etc.). It directly indicates how much the data values deviate from the central point (mean, median, etc.).

A **relative measure of dispersion** indicates how large the dispersion is relative to the central value of the data. These measures are typically dimensionless (i.e., they have no units) or for datasets that have different scales or units.


| Absolute           | Relative                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Range              | Coefficient of Range              |
| Variance           | Coefficient of Variation          |
| Standard Deviation | Coefficient of Mean Deviation     |
| Mean Deviation     | Coefficient of Quartile Deviation |
| Quartile Deviation |                                   |

### Choosing a measure of dispersion

- If the distribution is *symmetrical*, we often use the **average** as a *measure of location*. It is natural in this case to supplement with the **standard deviation** as a *measure of dispersion*. The standard deviation is, after all, based on the average.

- If the distribution is *skewed*, you will often use the **median** as a *measure of location*. In this case it is natural to supplement with the **IQR** as a *measure of dispersion*. The median might be perceived as the “middle quartile”.
