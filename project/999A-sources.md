### Premise

I haven't used a single source in this notebook, hence why I haven't added footnotes.

Oftentimes, I had to rely on multiple sources to write a single sentence, code snippet, or formula.

The content has to make sense *to me* first and foremost, as I haven't been able to find a single source that explains everything in a way that I can understand.

If it works for you, let me know. If it doesn't, let me know as well. I'm always looking to improve :)

### Not-so-good sources (in alphabetical order)

#### Statistics and Probability
- *Probability and statistics for computer scientists, third edition*, Michael Baron, CRC Press, 2019
    - Uses outdated notation and terminology, but the theoretical content is still useful
